/*
      The code demonstrates the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution using Kotlin coroutines.
      It uses the runBlocking coroutine builder to block the main thread until all coroutines inside it complete. Two coroutines are launched within
      runBlocking to show the behavior with and without context switching.

      The first coroutine is launched without context switching, running on the main thread.
      The second coroutine uses withContext(Dispatchers.Default) to switch to a background thread.
      The delay function is used to suspend the coroutine for a specified time without blocking the thread.
